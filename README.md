EE-551 Final Project

Author: Jarod Holgado

The goal of this project is to create an enjoyable text-based survival/puzzle game in Python. The overall format will essentially be an interactive story.

Features:
  - Players will be able to make choices that will progress an overall plot line (not entirely sure yet, but likely in a fantasy setting at this point)
  - Players will be challenged by increasingly difficult enemies and puzzles throughout the game
  - Players "win" by getting through the plot and "lose" if they are defeated by an enemy or stumped by a puzzle
  
To Do:
  - develop an overall setting and narrative for the game (the complexity of which will determine the overall scope of this project
  - begin developing possible puzzle formats and enemy types (maybe some sort of database for each)
  - consider persistance between sessions if the game is longer (possible save files)
  - consider randomness of enemy encounters and player choices 
  - consider creating a GUI instead of just running in a terminal
